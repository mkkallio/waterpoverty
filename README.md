# waterpoverty
R-code and other material related to my Master's Thesis about water poverty in Laos.


At the moment, the repository includes all the R-code I conjured in the process of working through my thesis. This repository will be updated with cleaned R-code, a html-version of the thesis with interactive plots and the data used in the thesis. R Shiny application is in the plans as well, however, timetable for this is still open.
